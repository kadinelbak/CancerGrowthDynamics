The files that say A2780UntreatFIT1uM: those are the A2780 (sensitive) cells, those were untreated for the first 7 days (Day1 to 7) and then they were treated at the IC50 concentration (1uM) for the next 7 days (Day 8 to 14) 
The files that say A2780cisUntreatFIT1uM: those are the A2780cis (resistant) cells, those were untreated for the first 7 days (Day1 to 7) and then they were treated at the IC50 concentration (1uM) for the next 7 days (Day 8 to 14) 
The files that say A2780IC50FIT1uM: those are the A2780 (sensitive) cells, those were treated at the IC50 concentration (1uM) for the first 7 days (Day1 to 7) and then they were untreated for the next 7 days (Day 8 to 14) 
The files that say A2780cisIC50FIT1uM: those are the A2780cis (resistant) cells, those were treated at the IC50 concentration (1uM) for the first 7 days (Day1 to 7) and then they were untreated for the next 7 days (Day 8 to 14) 

IC50 across the board was 1uM

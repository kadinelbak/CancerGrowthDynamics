# CHATGPT GENERATED BUT COOL FOR LATER USE

Julia can use as many CPU cores as your machine provides. Your **Ryzen 5 (5th gen)** likely has 6 cores / 12 threads. Julia won’t use all by default—you must enable and manage parallelism.

### 1. **Threading (Shared Memory, Multithreading)**

* Julia uses `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` to control threads.
* To check how many threads are active:

  ```julia
  Threads.nthreads()
  ```
* To launch Julia with all cores (e.g. 12):

  ```bash
  julia -t 12
  ```

  or set environment variable permanently:

  ```bash
  export JULIA_NUM_THREADS=12   # Linux/macOS
  setx JULIA_NUM_THREADS 12     # Windows
  ```

**Use in code**:

```julia
using Base.Threads

@threads for i in 1:100
    println("Iteration $i on thread $(threadid())")
end
```

ODE libraries like **DifferentialEquations.jl** automatically thread many operations (e.g., Jacobians, ensemble solves).

### 2. **Distributed Computing (Multi-process, not shared memory)**

* Launch multiple worker processes:

  ```julia
  using Distributed
  addprocs(6)   # add 6 workers
  @everywhere using DifferentialEquations
  ```
* Run tasks in parallel across processes. Useful when memory sharing isn’t needed.

---

### 3. **Parallel ODE Solving**

* For a single ODE system → threading helps internally, but scaling is limited.
* For **many ODE systems** (parameter sweeps, ensembles) → use `EnsembleProblem` in DifferentialEquations.jl.

Example:

```julia
using DifferentialEquations, DiffEqGPU

function f!(du,u,p,t)
    du[1] = -p*u[1]
end

u0 = [1.0]
tspan = (0.0, 10.0)
p = 1.0
prob = ODEProblem(f!, u0, tspan, p)

# Ensemble for 1000 different parameters
ensemble_prob = EnsembleProblem(prob)

sol = solve(ensemble_prob, Tsit5(), EnsembleThreads(), trajectories=1000)
```

* `EnsembleThreads()` → multi-threaded on CPU.
* `EnsembleDistributed()` → multi-process.
* `EnsembleGPUArray()` → run on GPU.

---

### 4. **Summary**

* Julia can use **all cores/threads** if you start it with the right thread count.
* For ODE work, **EnsembleProblem + EnsembleThreads()** is the easiest way to use multiple cores.
* For single large systems, Julia solvers already optimize with BLAS threading and Jacobian parallelization.

Do you want me to give you a **ready-to-run parallel ODE benchmark script** that maxes out your Ryzen 5 so you can see scaling in real time?
